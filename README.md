# Google.Scholar-Scraper

It was always a nightmare to collect information of papers on time of literature review.
So, I collected a group of Python programs to scrape data from Google Scholar.
You need to instal the relevant Python libraries such as beautifulsoup4 & SerpApi before running these codes.

There are 5 types of data scrapers

1- Organic results.
2- Profiles results.
3- Cite results.
4- Profile results.
5- Authors (articles, cited by, public access, co-authors) results.
